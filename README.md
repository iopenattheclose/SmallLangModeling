Project: Next Word Prediction for Gmail

This repo aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the next word in an email as the user types. It uses probabilistic models to compute the probability of words given a sequence of previous words.

Probablities of each word
Given a sequence of words, we can predict the probabilities of all other words and ascertain their chances of being the next word.
The word with the highest probability, given the sequence, can be suggested as the most probable "next word" to the user.
